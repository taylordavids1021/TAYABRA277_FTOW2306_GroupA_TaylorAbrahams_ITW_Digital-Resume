## Current Challenge:

Design resume website


## Instructions:

-Create a new repository on GitHub called digital-resume.
-Clone the repository locally and create a file called index.htm to serve as the entry point to your website.
-Create directories and files for any stylesheets, images, etc. that you will need.
-Please Note: Ensure that your document/project root has an index.html file, a readme.md file, and that your repository is public.
-Prepare for your live code demonstration and project presentation. You will be marked in a live, recorded, online session with your coach, where you will be required to present your final project and talk through your code, as well as answer any questions your coach may have.
-Make sure you are well prepared, as the session will be timeboxed to 15 minutes. In this time, you need to show that you understand what you have built and are confident in all concepts covered in the ITW Course.
